### Hi there 👋

My name is Jeremy (or "Jezza" 🇦🇺), and I am a freelance senior front-end developer currently helping [Upgrowth](https://www.upgrowth.com.au/) maintain BigW's storefront (previously @ [Publicis](https://www.publicis.com.au/), [Nightjar](https://nightjar.co), [Thinkmill](https://www.thinkmill.com.au/), [ustwo](https://www.ustwo.com/)).

- TypeScript, React.js & Next.js
- SCSS, Tailwind & CSS-in-JS libraries like Emotion
- CSS Animations, GSAP, React-Spring & Framer Motion

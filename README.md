### Hi there 👋

My name is Jeremy (or "Jezza" 🇦🇺), and I am a freelance web developer currently helping [Userkind](https://userkind.com.au/) developping fully-fledged marketing & e-commerce websites with headless CMSs like Sanity or Builder.io. I previously worked on maintaining [BigW](https://www.bigw.com.au)'s storefront, and before that I worked @ [Publicis](https://www.publicis.com.au/), [Nightjar](https://nightjar.co), [Thinkmill](https://www.thinkmill.com.au/), [ustwo](https://www.ustwo.com/)).

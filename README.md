### Hi there 👋

My name is Jeremy but in Australia, everybody calls me Jezza... even though it still doesn't make sense to me!

My job title at [ustwo](https://ustwo.com) says I'm a senior **full-stack** web developer, but deep inside I'll always be more of a **front-end** guy, or somewhat what they start calling a "UI engineer", for all these reasons:

😍  I love working with...

- JavaScript & TypeScript
- React.js & React Native
- Next.js & Gatsby.js
- SCSS & CSS-in-JS libraries
- CSS Animations & React-Spring
- Sketch & Figma (Yes, I like UI design too!)

✅  I have worked on these projects...

- Google's [Create with Google](https://create.withgoogle.com/) website (with Python & Jinja)
- Qantas's [Card Companion](https://cardcompanion.qantas.com/) website (with Next.js & GraphQL)
- Google's [Audience Connect](https://create.withgoogle.com/tools/audience-connect) desktop application (with Electron & Preact.js)
- Blackmores's [main website](https://blackmores.netlify.app) front-end revamp (with HTML & SCSS)
- John Mac Foundation's [website](https://johnmacfoundation.org/) (with WordPress)

🤓  I have also done a bit of open-source...

- [React-native-sketch](https://github.com/jgrancher/react-native-sketch), a React Native component for touch-based drawing (but I'm struggling to maintain it)

🔭. I’m currently working on ...

- [My portfolio](https://jeremygrancher.com) (well, it's a never ending project ya know!)
- A super secret mobile application with React Native - More to share soon!

🌱  I’m currently learning ...

- Three.js & React-Three-Fiber
- Gatsby.js
- FFMPEG

📭  You can reach out to me...

I am open to remote opportunities. [Let's chat](mailto:jgrancher@gmail.com?subject=Hello%20from%20Github%20!)!

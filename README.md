### Hi there 👋

My name is Jeremy - or "Jezza" 🇦🇺, and I currently work at [Leonardo.ai](https://leonardo.ai/) as a Senior Web Engineer where I help maintain the web platform, working alongside the API & AI teams.

Loving both the full-stack development and the creative coding space (the "front of the front-end"), I used to freelance and contract to build bespoke websites with headless CMSs like Sanity or Builder.io, and e-commerce storefronts with Shopify. Some clients and companies I worked for include: [BigW](https://www.bigw.com.au), [Publicis](https://www.publicis.com.au/), [Nightjar](https://nightjar.co), [Thinkmill](https://www.thinkmill.com.au/), [ustwo](https://www.ustwo.com/), and Google.

😍  I love working with...

- TypeScript, React.js & Next.js
- SCSS, Tailwind & CSS-in-JS libraries like Emotion
- Shopify & Headless CMSs like Contentful, Sanity, Builder.io
- CSS Animations, GSAP, React-Spring & Framer Motion

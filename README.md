### Hi there 👋

My name is Jeremy (or "Jezza" 🇦🇺), and I am a freelance senior front-end developer currently helping [Nightjar](https://nightjar.co) build slick, awards winning websites (previously @ [Thinkmill](https://www.thinkmill.com.au/) & [ustwo](https://www.ustwo.com/)).

😍  I love working with...

- TypeScript, React.js & Next.js
- SCSS, Tailwind & CSS-in-JS libraries like Emotion
- CSS Animations, GSAP, React-Spring & Framer Motion
- Sketch & Figma (Yes, I like design tools as well!)

✅  I have worked on these projects...

- Google's [Create with Google](https://create.withgoogle.com/) website (with Python & Jinja)
- Qantas's [Card Companion](https://cardcompanion.qantas.com/) website (with Next.js & GraphQL)
- Google's [Audience Connect](https://create.withgoogle.com/tools/audience-connect) desktop application (with Electron & Preact.js) - EDIT: Now sunset by Create with Google 😔
- Blackmores's [main website](https://blackmores.netlify.app) front-end revamp (with HTML & SCSS)
- John Mac Foundation's [website](https://johnmacfoundation.org/) (with WordPress)

🤓  I have also done a bit of open-source...

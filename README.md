### Hi there 👋

My name is Jeremy (or Jezza in 'Straya 🇦🇺), and I currently work at [Thinkmill](https://www.thinkmill.com.au/) (previously [ustwo](https://www.ustwo.com/)) as a senior **full-stack** developer. Deep inside though, I'll always be more of a **front-end** guy.

😍  I love working with...

- JavaScript / TypeScript
- React.js & React Native
- Next.js & Gatsby.js
- SCSS & CSS-in-JS libraries like Emotion
- CSS Animations, React-Spring & Framer Motion
- Sketch & Figma (Yes, I like design tools as well!)

✅  I have worked on these projects...

- Semi Permanent's [new website](https://semipermanent.com/) (with Next.js, Emotion, Framer Motion & Contentful's GraphQL API)
- Google's [Create with Google](https://create.withgoogle.com/) website (with Python & Jinja)
- Qantas's [Card Companion](https://cardcompanion.qantas.com/) website (with Next.js & GraphQL)
- Google's [Audience Connect](https://create.withgoogle.com/tools/audience-connect) desktop application (with Electron & Preact.js) - Now killed by Google 😔
- Blackmores's [main website](https://blackmores.netlify.app) front-end revamp (with HTML & SCSS)
- John Mac Foundation's [website](https://johnmacfoundation.org/) (with WordPress)

🤓  I have also done a bit of open-source...

- [react-native-sketch](https://github.com/jgrancher/react-native-sketch), a React Native component for touch-based drawing (but I'm struggling to maintain it)

🔭. I’m currently working on ...

- [My portfolio](https://jeremygrancher.com) (well, it's a never ending project ya know!)
- [Enlitic](https://enlitic.com)'s platform & design system

🌱  I’m currently learning ...

- [Three.js](https://threejs-journey.xyz/) & React-Three-Fiber
